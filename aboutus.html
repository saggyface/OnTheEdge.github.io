									<h4>About Us</h4>
								
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span>Welcome to On The Edge, a 
										family-owned and operated coffee shop located in the historic Old Town Clovis 
										district of California. Scott and Julie Glenn founded our caf√© with a passion 
										for coffee and a vision to create a welcoming space that celebrates the local 
										community and the simple pleasures of life. <br> <br> As coffee enthusiasts, 
										we believe that great coffee is more than just a beverage, it's an art 
										form. That's why we carefully source and roast our coffee beans to create a 
										rich and smooth blend that will tantalize your taste buds and give you the energy 
										you need to tackle the day ahead. From classic drip coffee to lattes, cappuccinos, 
										and more, we offer a wide range of coffee selections to suit every taste and preference.
										<br><br>But we're more than just coffee. We also offer a delicious selection of food 
										items that are perfect for any time of the day. From savory bagel sandwiches and mini 
										pizzas to fresh salads and wraps, our food menu is made with fresh ingredients and bursting 
										with flavor. We also cater to those with a sweet tooth, with our freshly baked pastries and 
										desserts that are sure to satisfy your cravings.</p>
		
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/pic05.jpg" alt="" /></span>At On The Edge, we are 
										more than just a coffee shop, we are a community hub where friends and families gather to connect 
										and create memories. Our cozy and laid-back atmosphere is the perfect backdrop for catching up with 
										friends, enjoying live music performances, or simply taking a moment to yourself to unwind and recharge. <br><br>
										We are proud to be a locally owned and operated business, and we take pride in serving our community 
										with the warm hospitality and personalized service that sets us apart. Whether you're a local or a 
										visitor, we invite you to join us and experience the joy of great coffee, delicious
										 food, and friendly company. <br><br>Here, we believe that every customer is unique, 
										 and we're committed to providing a personalized and exceptional experience for each person who 
										 walks through our doors. Whether you're a regular or a first-time visitor, our friendly and 
										 knowledgeable staff will go above and beyond to ensure that your visit is memorable and enjoyable. 
										 We value your feedback and are always looking for ways to improve and better serve our customers. <br><br>
